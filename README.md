# hyper-python
This is a working project that I'm going to use to publish my progress learning Python from Hiperskill

Jetbrains Academy has been so helpful for me to start my career as a programme and I am pretty sure that many people feel the same as me.
These are the pieces of code I have made during the course, which are project based. 

Since I am still learning the scripts might be a little messy, still, I hope you find them useful
